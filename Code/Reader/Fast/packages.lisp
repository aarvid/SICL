;;; getting the list of those symbols using the function 
;;; package-shadowing symbols.  But since defpackage doesn't evaluate
;;; the symbols in the :shadowing-import-from list, we need to 
;;; have the reader produce that list, hence the use of the #. reader
;;; macro and again of the consing dot followed by a list.
